# Drop a Ball
An experiment to create a learning exercise for programming and more

The basic idea is to start with the minimum scene, where a ball (a circle) drops from top of the page and stops when it comes to ground level. No physics, no complex calculations or graphics. It is all about trying to replicate the expected behavior with minimum coding possible. Then we start adding to this simple scene, growing it to become more complex in different dimensions and along the way we validate our expectations from the dropping ball. It aims to exercise programming, math, phtsics and reasoning skills. 

Disclaimer: I do not claim to be an expert in any of the above skills. I see this as a learning exercise myself as well.
